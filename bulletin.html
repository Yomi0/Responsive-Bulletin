    <h4> I dare to call him father</h4>
    
    <p>Before I was born He knew my name, He gave me breath and life abundantly, He prospered the works of my hands and multiplied me, then spoke saying "I have arrived". </p>
    
    <p> He beckoned to me and I turned a deaf ear. He knocked at the door of my heart but I refused to answer. I wallowed in sin and the flesh took me, I thought there wasn't any more to life and that I had it all. </p>
    
    <p>Then all of a sudden the cares of this world enveloped me, my days were dreary and my nights long and scary, my fears shook me and I began to lose all I had. </p>
    
    <p>Then I remembered that He was still at the door, knocking and waiting. I turned to him and called him "FATHER", and he turned to me and said "Son, I have always been here." I wept and said "Lord, I am sorry.". He said to me "Welcome to the fold." From then on I call Him, FATHER.</p>
